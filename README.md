### Hi! There is my fist project at <a href='https://ru.hexlet.io/'>Hexlet</a> course for Frontend developers.

This is a repository with five games that run on the command line! To install the game, enter 'make install' in the console, then 'make publish'. There are 5 available games in the 'bin' directory, to start each of them, you need to enter the name of the game in the make + console, for example: 'make brain-calc'. To win each of the games, you must answer 3 questions correctly in a row. 

ðŸŽŠ Good luck and may the strongest win! ðŸŽŠ

#### Minimum system requirements and installation/startup instructions
For those who have Windows: install wsl, the game will start only there
For those with iOS: you don't need to install anything extra. The project runs on Linux and Ubuntu

To install the game, enter "make install" in the terminal, then "npm link". 

There are 5 games to choose from. Choose the one that you liked the most and by entering "make (name of the game)" into the terminal - enjoy the game!

Names of games and examples of entering commands into the terminal:
1. make brain-calc
2. make brain-even
3. make brain-gcd
4. make brain-prime
5. make brain-progression
